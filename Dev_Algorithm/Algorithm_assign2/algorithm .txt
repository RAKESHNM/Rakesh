Algorithm for finding median of two sorted arrays of equal size.

Method 1.

Step 1.Let ar1 and ar2 be the two arrays eqaul size n.
Step 2.Let m1 and m2 be the medians of arrays ar1 and ar2 respectively.
Step 3.Trace elements of ar[1] and ar[2] until either i or j reaches to n.
Step 4.Store ar[i] and ar[j] to m1 and m2.
Step 5.Median=(m1+m2)/2;

Method 2.

Step 1.Let ar1 and ar2 be 2 arrays with medians m1 and m2 with size n each.
Step 2. a)If n is odd
            m1=ar1[n/2];
            m2=ar2[n/2];
        
        b)if n is even
             m1=(ar1[n/2]+ar1[n/2+1])/2;
             m2=(ar2[n/2]+ar2[n/2+1])/2;
Step 3.If m1 and m2 are eqaul then median is either m1 or m2
Step 4.if m1<m2
       Eliminate the elements which are lesser than m1 in ar1 and elements which are greater than m2 in ar2.

Step 5.if m1>m2
       Eliminate the elements which are greater than m1 in ar1 and elements which are lesser than m2 in ar2.

Step 6.Repeat Step4 and Step5 until we get 2 elements in each array.
Step 7.Median=(Median = (max(ar1[0], ar2[0]) + min(ar1[1], ar2[1]))/2)
